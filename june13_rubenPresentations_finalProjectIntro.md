## Giving Great Presentations

Here are the keys to a great presentation

### Preperation

#### Know your audience

- Understand interests
- Tailor Content
- Meet Expectations

#### Define your purpose

- Inform, persuade, entertain, inspire
- Business, sales, personal, affinity group

#### Create an outline

Start with an outline

##### Logical Flow and Transitions

- Purpose
- Main points with supporting details
- Add visual and verbal aids

### Delivery

#### Engage with a strong opening

- Start with a hook
  - question(s)
  - quote
  - anecdote/story
  - startling fact
  - anything that makes people start thinking

#### Use clear and concise language

- Avoid jargon, complex terms, or internal acronyms
- Aim for simplicity and clarity in your explanations
  - Also, keep your deck simple so people can glance at it, and not pay attention to you

#### Employ storytelling

- Use stories to illustrate key points
- Make presentation relatable
- Personal anecdotes add authenticity and emotion
  - Don't sound like a robot
- Stories are memorable

#### Incorporate visual aids

- Use slides, charts, or props to support your points
- Ensure visuals are clear, relevant, and not complex

#### Maintain eye contact and smile

- Connect with your audience by making eye contact
- This helps build trust and keeps the audience engaged

#### Vary tone and pace

- use changes in tone and speed to emphasize key points and maintain interest
- avoid a monotonous delivery
  - shouldn't be too low energy, but too high energy can be a problem as well

#### Effective body language

- Use gestures to reinforce your message
- Stand confidently and avoid figeting
- movement and proximity
- smiling and facial expressions
- posture

#### Engage with audience

- Ask questions or invite participation
  - if you see you're losing your audience kick up the energy or start getting people involved
- respond to audience reactions and feedback

#### Use pauses effectively

- Pause to emphasize points
- also gives the audience time to absorb information
- avoid filling pauses with filler words like "um" or "uh"
