# June 3rd, 2024 Notes

Today, we're discussing the unspoken rules of corporate America!

## Unspoken Rules

Morgan is delivering the presentation today. According to Morgan, there's a great resource by Gorick Ng, a former guidance counselor/career coach at Harvard University.

- Many students would come from different cultures, and wouldn't understand the subtleties of American Corporate Culture.
- To remedy this issue he wrote a book called The Unspoken Rules
- Wednesday at 8 a.m., Ruben has a book club, and they're finishing up The Little Black Book of Corporate America.

### Microsoft Office

- One of the unspoken rules of corporate America is that people all know how to use Microsoft Office Suite off the rip, which may not be the case.
- Today we're starting out by taking a Microsoft Office Assessment to identify areas of strength and development
  - We'll cover:
    - Excel
      - Before Juneteenth, a DPI staff member will give a presentation on V Lookups and Pivot Tables
    - Powerpoint
      - Jackie from our UI/UX team will come in and give a presentation on how to make a professional powerpoint presentation
    - Word
    - Outlook
