## LinkedIn
 - Linkedin is a tool for recruiters to find the best people
 - The more you have on your profile **the easier it is to have your profile show up in filters**

### Profile Optimization
- When recruiters filter, they see the years of experience in the job title they're searching for
    - Recruiters often filter for **skills, keywords, job titles, and locations**
- An optimized profile:
    - increases visibility
    - enhances pro branding
    - showcases expertise 
    - attracts relevant opportunities
    - helps you stand out for competition
    - helps you grow professionally
- Education for some hiring managers is more important than experience

#### Profile URL
- should include dashes between words

#### Profile Pic
- professional, not too social
- approchable

#### Profile Cover
- interesting but not too busy

#### Headline
- Quick, who you are and what's your industry
- How do you feel about the word aspiring?

#### About section 
- 3 W's - Be sure to incorporate keywords - speaking skills, communication skills, mentorship
    - Where you were 
    - Where you are
    - What you want to do
- Include:
    - Relevant Skills
    - Keywords

#### Experience
- Focus on achievements and quantify results (e.g. Increased Sales by 20%)
    - If you don't have metrics tied to your achievements, you can still include numbers (wrote 100+ press releases, led a team of four people, etc)
    - Include skills in your descriptions of job tasks
- Use STAR Method
    - Explain the situation, tasks, actions, and results
- Add skills for your experience, it'll help you apply to jobs on linkedin
- Emphasize projects for now, keep an eye out for results

#### Skills and Endorsements
- List skills that are pertinent to your career and the positions you are targeting
- Prioritize the most relevant skills at the top
- Double down on skills from your experience section

#### Creating a Network
- Increased visibility and job opportunities
- Knowledge sharing and learning
- Building credibility and trust
- Collaboration and partnerships
- personal branding and influence
- support during career transitions
- **connect with recruiters**

#### Personalized Connection Requests
- Start with a greeting
    - Add a personal connection moment to remind them who you are if you have one
    - If not, share a common interest
        - I love your background, I'd love to talk and learn more
- Thank them and sign off
- Follow up with a thank you after they accept
- You can sometimes send short relevant videos

#### Applying for jobs
- Apply for roles through LinkedIn and on company websites
- Do **NOT** apply through easy apply
- **Always** include a cover letter
- Many job postings will have skills in them, so try to add those skills to your profile
