Today, Haneen is giving us tips on behavioral and technical interviews

## Interviewing Tips

- Most Software engineering interviews are focused on data structures and algorithms

### Data Structures and Algorithms

- Here are the important topics to know
  - Arrays, strings, loops, conditionals, stacks, queues, hash tables, linked lists
  - Sorting and searching, trees and traversals, heaps, graphs and search algorithms

### Technical interviewing

- Communicate your thought process, companies are interested in how you approach a problem
- If you're an internal processor, let your interviewer know
- Ask clarifying questions to confirm your understanding
- Take the initiative if it's quiet and ask questions or continue talking
- Break down the problem into manageable pieces and focus on one piece at a time
- Talk through an example to test your solution and account for edge cases
- Is your interviewer trying to give you a hint or nudge you in the right direction?
  - If they offer advice, internalize it and try to implement it

#### Write out Pseudocode

- You can start by writing out pseudo code, talking through your thought process before actually diving into the problem
- Be aware of your coding style
- Test edge cases and proactively identify and resolve bugs
