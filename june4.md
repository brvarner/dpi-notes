Today, we're discussing networking with Ruben!

## Networking

We'll probably have two networking sessions according to Ruben.

- It's what you know, but WHO you know, but really it's WHO KNOWS YOU!
- How do we make networking more fun and less intimidating?
  - Today's more about breaking the ice and getting comfortable, maybe Thursday we'll talk about building relationships
  - Whenever going to a networking event, it's always good to have a plan
    - Are you going to meet the speaker?
    - Are you interested in the topic?
    - Do you know if it'll help you?
  - Know who you want to meet?
    - Quantity or quality? **Both!**
      - Sometimes to get to the quality, you have to meet a whole lot of people before you find the ones who are right for you.
  - Naturally, do your research before attending events
    - Ruben updates his list of networking events often, **you can email him to join his list**
      - the one's he's attending are highlighted in red
    - Some organizations will give you a list of attendees before attending events so you can go see who they are on linkedin
      - At the very least, research the speakers
- How to do it
  - You get to the event, you've done the research, but maybe the people that you researched don't show up

### Talk to as many people as possible!

- Network anywhere and everywhere, if you're at an event, anything is an opportunity to meet new folks
- Find out what each person does, and if you know who they are, then you can determine what you think
- Be an active listener, try to get people to talk more about themselves, and make sure to give them your undivided attention
  - Find out their job title
- **Research DPI and know enough to explain it properly**
  - Started when Chicago didn't get Amazon, and they wanted to train a workforce to become a leading tech city.
- Pay attention to body language

#### Breaking into an existing conversation

- If people are already talking, you don't have to just sit there and wait
- Bring a notebook to events, write down people's names and make little notes, especially if it's a high-value connection
- **Ask if you can join people!**
  - Everyone's there to meet people anyway, so there are very low chances that you'll end up being rejected
- You can get people's info at **any time** sometimes it helps to do it at the beginning of the conversation
  - There are lots ways to do it with a digital card.
    - LinkedIn has a built-in QR code that allows people to scan and connect immediately
    - **Take a picture of paper business cards so that you don't lose them**

#### Take the initiative

- If there's a table that's already talking, try and find a connection, and ask if you can have a seat
- **Make Jokes**
  - Most folks are kinda the same
  - C-suite folks especially don't get a lot of folks joking with em, so don't get intimidated
  - **Don't get intimidated!**
    - It's a networking event, EVERYONE is trying to meet people!
    - If you are sitting in a lobby or something, and you're wondering who someone is, go up and talk to them
- How do we maintain a connection?
  - If you meet someone important, you can reach out ASAP
  - Sometimes folks will reach out to you
  - **At MOST, wait 24 hours for a hot lead**
  - **Don't sell people right away, ALWAYS make a connection**

### LinkedIn

- You can reach out to just about anybody as long as you have a good opener
- LinkedIn is your lil **infomercial**, so make sure your profile matches what you're trying to put out there
  - Carefully consider your banner photo. It should reflect who you are and what you're trying to do
- Look at upcoming conferences, and articles in the space you're connecting with someone around to look a bit more connected
  - Ex: Hey, did you see this article? Hey did you know about this thing coming up?
    - Hyperlocal news is great especially, **always bring something to the table**
