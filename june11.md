            - Walk around wide rooms, stop for a couple of seconds, stand still
            - Make eye contact for a couple of seconds with poeple 
    - A great speech is like a great song (TONE MATTERS)
        - We have a bias towards tones and voices that are confident and authoritative even though they could be wrong
        - Tone, Speed, Variation
            - **Tone, Pitch**
                - Young women's tone/pitch tends to go up at the end of a sentence
                - there's no such thing as too low
            
            - **Slow Down**
                - Makes you sound more authoritative
            - **Vary Both for Emphasis**
                - Speed up, then slow down to make your point
        - Slow, Brief, Repeat
            - **The Power of the Pause**
                - comprehension occurs in the pauses
            - **Repeat, Repeat, Repeat**
                - repetition is VERY important to drive home your point
            - **14 word limit**
                - Humans can't follow anything longer than 14 words without a pause
                - Idealy, you'd like to pause every six or seven words
### Job Interview Tips
- Pause before you jump
    - Take your time to start thinking of your beginning answer
    - **You HAVE to pause**
- Lead with a topic sentence
- Then support it with an example of data
- Imagine a single paragraph
- Avoid jargon or big words
- More is not more
    - Get your answers tight and concise, so you don't feel nervous
    - If you talk more and faster to give deeper answers, you can come off as rushed or nervous
#### Tough Q&A
- **Acknowledge, Bridge, and Contribute (ABC)**
    - When asked a question, especially something difficult, acknowledge, bridge, contribute
        - Acknowledge a question 
        - Bridge it to the topic you'd LIKE to talk about
        - Contribute something based on your topic
- **Use Analogies**
    - Especially those that the person you're speaking to can understand
- **Personalize your answers**
    - Make the question and your message about your personal choices and experiences
- **On guessing**
    - It's ok to not know
        - Follow up within 24 hours then shut up
    - It's ok to say you're the wrong person to answer the question
