## Durable Skills: Excel w/ Tula

- Today, Tula is walking us through some great excel info!
  - She manages DPI's salesforce platform, and uses excel to regularly clean data

### Important Stuff

- You can use a filter and sort on the data to put it in alphabetical order
- You can **right click** on the first row of a form to do filters and sorts

### Pivot Tables

- You can create a pivot table by highlighting all the info in the work book using the arrow in the top left of the sheet
- Click create pivot table in a new sheet, and you can drag and drop the labels in the left values and stuff to get counts etc of specific values, helps you get an idea of multiple anything

### Conditional formatting

- You can highlight matching cells, or cells that have a specific value by applying conditional formatting in from the home tab

### VLookup - EXTREMELY IMPORTANT

- You can add a column to crossreference information across different sheets on one page
- You click insert function and select vlookup
  - You select the matching value across both tables(email, name, etc)
  - You then select the cell value's location and more info before completing it
  - After a vlookup, the cells hold the Vlookup formula
    - You **must copy the column and paste special-values only** to get rid of the formula and properly preserve the data in your table
    - It's still linked to the original locations so if you make all your changes, then they'll be reflected UNTIL you replace the values

### You Can Protect Your Sheets

### Wrap text allows you to fit text to a column width

- Go to the Home tab, and hit the wrap text

### Printing

- You can format before printing
  - If you want all the info on one page, there's an option for that
  - If you want to add the gridlines, there's an option for that
