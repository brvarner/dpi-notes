Today, Jiaqi is giving a presentation on making a great slide deck! Ian is presenting on pain points as we get to the final project ideas

# Ian's Corner

## Pain Points

- don't just think of something, look around and start thinking of solutions for problems, preferably problems that affect people **urgently** and **every day**

### Vitamin, painkiller, or cure?

- Always think about how **well** you solve the pain for the customer

#### Vitamin

- Indirect, long-term benefits that address general health or minor problems
- nice ot havve
- won't wreck your day if you forget to take them

#### Painkiller

- Necessary short-term fixes to pressing issues
- May not solve the underlying issue

#### Cure

- Make the problem go away entirely

#### Which one?

- User's willingness to pay or use product depends directly on their need for your product
- The more impressive the problem-solving, the more valuable

### Keep it simple

- The best ideas address simple pain points
- "Can your mom explain it?"
  - If so, you've got a great simple idea

### If people are hacking your product

- If people are hacking your product and using it in an unexpected way, then you can double down on that

# Making a great deck

## A great deck is

- Engaging
- Coherent
- Impactful

## UX Mindset

- Approach designing with a UX mindset
  - Provide meaningful and relevant experience to the audience
  - focused on usability functionality, and accessibility
  - You're creating an interactive experience wiht your audience, just like an app

### Who is the audience?

- Adjust the tone, visuals, and cadence of your design to suit your audience

### What is the purpose?

- What should your audience take away from your presentation?

### How is it being presented?

- Ted Talk or elevator pitch?

## A brief guide to visual design principles

### Less is more

- Removing unnecessary content will help the audience focus on what's important

### Contrast is key

- Relativity and hierarchy matter when making a point

### Keep it consistent

- A must to making your point land

### Go Big or Go Home

- Don't make people squint, ensure

## Making a presi

There are a few steps to making an effective prezi

### Start with a Theme

- A simple theme is more applicable to diverse content
  - Color-block/geometric/coll tone
    - Pitching/professional/business
  - Textured/hand-written/warm tone
    - educational/aspirational/idea-sharing
- Try customizing the theme or switching the color and font around

### Typography

#### Readability comes first

1. Pick a common font for the body text
2. Adjust default line height or letter spacing as needed
3. Give the Eyes space to breathe

- Jiaqi likes
  - Roboto
  - Helvetica
  - Verdana
  - Times New Roman
  - Lato

#### Font pairing

##### Contrast, Contrast, Contrast

1. Match serif with sans-serif
2. Regular and **Bold**, but don't go thin
3. Set up title, caption and body text hierarchy
   - set up these styles when creating your presentations

- **Good Pairs**
  - Playfair display/oswald

#### Visual hierarchy

- size, color, and more makes a big difference

#### Color

- Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) recommends a visual presentation of text has a contrast ratio of 4.5:1

- 1-2-3 rule
  Jiaqi picks: - 1 primary color that pops - 2 accent colors - 3 complementary colors
- Find colors pleasant to the eyss
  - Stick with earthish tones and such, as bright neon colors can make people's eyes hurt
- Try to stick with black or white text

### Composition

- Start with a blank slide
  - Let your content dictate your composition
- Alternate composition to avoid visual fatigue
  - Don't use the same slide template over and over
- Use image or graphic elements to offset heavy text
- Align similar elements to create visual balance
- Don't be afraid to go big with your image
  - make a nice image the focal point of your slide

### Show don't tell

We can use mockups or graphics to explain concepts or data

- Types of content that could benefit from visualization

1. Scenarios - workflow/journey/stages/processes/cycles
2. Comparison - competitive/similarity/marketplace/A&B/SWOT analysis
3. Data - percentage/demographic/distro/outlier/trend

- Powerpoint has a tool called smartchart which helps you create diagrams for your content

### Ways to create consistency

1. Repeating elements
   - Visual elements appear in most slides like logos, colors, etc
2. Visual styling
   - size/color/parining/shadow/solid v hollow/etc
3. Relative Position
   - position relative to neighboring elements and page
     - page position
     - line height
     - spacing b/t text

### Workflow tips

1. create a style sheet
   - put all the typography, color, and style variation in one slide and use it as a reference.
2. Copy and paste repeating elements
   - Copy and paste allows you to maintain the elements' relative position
3. Zoom out
   - put all your slides together. Do they fall under one theme? is there a rhythm to all your slides?
