# June 12, 2024 Notes
Today, we had a visit from Babitha Gopinathan, Managing Director from JP Morgan's Commercial and Investment Banking wing. This was a BIG DEAL! It was our first riverside chat ðŸ«¡

## Riverside with Babitha (Bob-BEE-Tha)
- She gave us great tips on preparing for our careers, I didn't take notes like a dummy lol, but a commitment to learning is important

## Ian's Corner
- Agile V Waterfall
    - Agile is working in short cycles, delivering things quickly, and adjusting/iterating often
    - Waterfall is working on a long timeline towards a goal and then calling it a day after the project ships
- **Technical Debt**
    - Technical debt is when you borrow from your future self to get something done quickly, but it may result in problems down the road
