# June 6, 2024 Notes

Today, Ruben is giving us part two of his presentation on Networking.

Next, we're doing the follow up. Goto June 4 for continued notes

## Ian's Corner

Today, we're discussing Git. Version control is common, but code review is something that we haven't covered

### Code Review

- Git code review can be a good way to learn new things
  - Sometimes, people will give you alternative ways to attack a problem
  - There are times where juniors may even show seniors a thing or two
- Code reviews are great for demolishing knowledge silos too, ensuring a good sharing of knowledge
- Code reviews can help catch bugs

### Git Flow

There's an order of operations with git

- Main branch
  - Usuallly the production branch, the sacred one
- Feature branch
  - branches made to try new features out and maybe break things
- Get the main branch, pull to get the latest, and then checkout -b to start a new branch
- Once your work is complete, make a pull request
  - Pull requests can become conversations with senior devs

#### Git Lens/Git Graph

- There are visualizations that can show you branches and progress
- Git Grpah is one, there's a Git lens extension for vs code as well
